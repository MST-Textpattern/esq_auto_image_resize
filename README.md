esq_autoimageresize
===================

Textpattern plugin to automatically resize uploaded images.

See forum thread [here](http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=34756) for use (I'll update this readme eventually, this is just an initial migration from Google Code).

To download the plugin compiled for Textpattern, go [here](http://popularsizzle.com.au/txp_plugins/esq_autoimageresize) (code in this repo is uncompiled source code).
